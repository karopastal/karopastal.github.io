1. how physics shapes machine learning and artificial intelligence?
   show practicale examples of datasets that describes the universe and how
   machine learning/AI mind set helps solving thous problems, which we can make an
   induction to other topics of ML/AI. 

   ####refrences: 
   1. [ML and the nature of universe]
   2. [Why does deep and cheap learning work so well?]
   3. []

2. Digit recognition tutorial - step by step build a web application for drawing digits and
   the training the algorithm, try to explain the math behind it.
   (try with Python then Elixir)

   3. [Kaggle digit recognizer]
   4. [mxnet mnist tutorial]

3. Calculus, Analysis tips and tricks.

4. mechanics suloutions. polorize the math from the ideas and build intuitive
   explanation for everyone of them.
5. Style it takes - ML algo to interrior design/clothing design.. \*design
  (flow machines), markov matricies.

6. humor detection - train data:  popular funny content, function([news,
   current events, 9gag]) { return jokes,memes };
   can we fight racisem, prejudice, deal with embasedoreship.
   but if an AI process using this methods, how we know he isnt bias?
   what bias is? and why we care so much about objectivity(can we represent
   a proposition with vector and test his linearly independent?)

7. learning motivator - ai machine for gaps detection between skill and challenge.
